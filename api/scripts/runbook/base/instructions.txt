Preheat oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit. 
Roughly chop onions, pepper, and mushrooms. And toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper. 
Spread vegetables on a baking sheet and cook for 20 - 30 minutes until well roasted.
Pull veggies from oven and let cool slightly. 
Throw veggies in a food processor to finely chop, or chop more coarsely on a cutting board.
Add chopped veggies, ground turkey, salt and pepper to a large bowl and mix well.
Form into patties or meatballs to freeze. If forming patties, separate patties with a small piece of parchment paper. 
Or pack mixture into a zip lock bag and worry about the form later.
