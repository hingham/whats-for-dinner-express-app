100g active starter - ~12 hrs after it has been fed. Starter should have doubled and be very bubbly. Can wait longer starter doesn't look hungry enough after 12 hrs.
400g water
10g salt
512 g bread flour

1. Mix starter, water, and salt together in a bowl until starter is mostly dissolved. It does not need to be fully incorporated.
2. Stir in flour. Dough will be sticky.
3. Perform folds at 15 - 30 minute increments for up to 2 hours after mixing dough. 1 fold is satisfactory, 4 folds is fantastic. Don't stress this part too much.
4. Let dough sit loosely covered with cloth for 3 - 6 hours. Dough should rise 50% to 100% in volume. Air bubble may form on top. Consider rise, room temperature, and age of starter before moving to next step. Young starter and cooler room temp indicate longer rise time is needed.
5. Tip bowl and release dough onto lightly floured surface. Fold dough in thirds to form a loose rectangle. Place seam side down in bread dish. This step feels a bit messy and it is ok if the dough doesn't make in the bread dish seam side down.
6. Let rise for another 8 - 12 hours. Alternatively can put bread in fridge for 24 - 36 hours. 
7. When ready to bake, preheat oven to 425 degrees fahrenheit. Score through the middle, trying to get at least 1/2 deep. A skin on the dough from sitting out will help with scoring.
8. Drizzle a bit of oil in the score. This ensures the dough doesn't dry out in the oven before the dough can rise into the break in the bread.
9. Put dough in oven for 25 minutes. Lower temp to 350 and let bread bake for another 20 minutes. Dough should be a nice deep brown on top. Give it another 5 minutes if crust hasn't turned a rich brown.
10. Pop bread of pan immediately (letting it cool in the pan will lead to soggy crust). Let bread cool on wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing.
